GeoTrellis SBT Template
=======================

This is a bare-bones project template that can be used to begin any new
application that uses GeoTrellis.

An `sbt` bootstrapping script is also supplied, so you don't even need to
have `sbt` installed on your system.

To fetch this repo:

```console
git clone https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis-sbt-template.git
```

To pull dependencies and run tests:

```console
./sbt test
```
